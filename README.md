# SummerFellowship2020
NFL Big Data Bowl Summer Fellowship through St. Lawrence University

The project attempted to replicate and build on the work done by the winners of the NFL Big Data Bowl competition in 2020. In this competition, the NFL released player tracking data consisting of over 72 million datapoints, tracking all movements of 250 players over the course of several seasons. The goal of the project was to model non-contact lower leg injuries.

This repo contains for markdown documents. The first focused on reading and cleaning the data, as well as providing basic summary statistics. The next build a gif that was able to animate a football field and track player movement, speed, and acceleration throughout a play. This could be done by simply selecting the unique play_ID which is different for each player and player. The final two focus on modeling, attempting to use logistic regression to model and predict the injuries. 

The two gifs labeled position and speed model the movement of a reciever during a play, noting the current action of the play. (from line set to quaterback sack).
